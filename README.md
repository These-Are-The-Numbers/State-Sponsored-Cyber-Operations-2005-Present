# YEAR 18 (August 25, 2005 - Present)
This is a dataset that tracks **state-sponsored cyber operations** across the globe since 2005.

All data are official figures from the **Council of Foreign Relations** that have been compiled and structured by myself. I decided to create this dataset to explore how countries around the world are **funding cyber operations to gain political leverage**. As human civilization becomes further entrenched into the Digital Age, the necessity for *increased government spending on cybersecurity* becomes equally apparent. I hope that this dataset not only highlights the widespread usage of cyber operations by states, but also how cybersecurity will protect a government's **own interests** in the process. 

# Data Sources
##### The primary data source used was the **Council on Foreign Relations**, an independent and nonpartisan American think tank specializing in U.S. foreign policy and international relations. Founded in 1921, the organization does not take policy positions but instead sponsors discussion, analysis, and research on various topics regarding foreign affairs.

1. [Cyber Operations Tracker](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/) - The Council on Foreign Relations's Digital and Cyberspace Policy program offers a database of publicly known state-sponsored cyber operations since 2005. Through its meticulous compilation of information from various accredited institutions, the Council on Foreign Relations has created one of the most complete databases on cyber incidents to date.

# Statistics Being Tracked
